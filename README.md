# Searching

This is just a test repository for a string search algorithm. The point is not so much to implement the algorithm or run the tests, but to illustrate how we can set up a repository to work with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org), [codecov](https://codecov.io/gh), and [codacy](https://www.codacy.com).
